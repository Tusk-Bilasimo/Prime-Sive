# Prime-Sive
Description

It begins with the only true prime pair 2 and 3, whose product forms the magical composite number 6. 
All other primes orbit around it and its multiples. Using alternating patterns of 2 and 4, 
the composites are revealed in succession beginning with 5 in the first segregated pair of the series. 
Each integer in the series is raised to the second power and then its product of 2 and 4 reveals the distribution of the composite numbers.
As the process is repeated, the order that 2 and 4 are used to generate the products alternates, 
to progressively strip away the remaining composites integers and reveal the rest of the primes.
